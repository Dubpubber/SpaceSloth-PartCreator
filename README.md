# Project Purpose
In my other game, SpaceSloth, the main ship the player uses is completely modular. Meaning each part can be swapped out, increasing the ship's characteristics in different ways. This tool was created to further randomize the process. The SpaceSloth-PartCreator can generator any individual part to an entire ship!

My name is Tyler Crowe, I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I try to put aside time every week specifically for creating to further grow my skills. I’ve been programming for about 8 years now and have no plans on stopping now!
